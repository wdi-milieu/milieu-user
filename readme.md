Milieu User Survey Platform

The Milieu survey platform is where you can let your voice be heard, and use the power of masses to help brands improve how they provide you with better products and services.

Milieu also provides value back to our users by providing aggregated and social data which provides that a place to interact with others and share their opinions.

In the long term, we will aim to also use algorithms to provide product and service recommendations that are relevant and not intrusive to our users.

Information on individual users is strictly kept confidential and only aggregated level data is shown and shared.
